Ormuco Hiring Process Technical Test

Each file contains a script answering each respective question.
For question C, I was only able to generate an LRU cache and was not able to implement it with geo-distribution. However, with some research, I was able to find information on how to construct these and I believe that it would be fairly intuitive to integrete it with the LRU cache I developed.

To view results of the each question just run each python script individually and the results should print to screen.
