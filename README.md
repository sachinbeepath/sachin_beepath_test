Ormuco Hiring Process Technical Test

Each file contains a script answering their respective question.
For question C, I was able to generate an LRU cache, but unfortunately was not able to implement it for geo-distribution. However, with some research, I was able to find information on how to construct these and I believe that it would be fairly intuitive to integrate it with the LRU cache I developed.

To view the results for each question, you will need to run each python script individually and the results will print to screen.
